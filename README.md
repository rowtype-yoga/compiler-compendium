# compiler-compendium

An exeperimental PureScript compiler that runs on Code Llama.

# name

The project's name comes from Shin Megami Tensei, which has a _fusion_ mechanism where you can merge two demons. The way to summon them is called the [**demonic compendium**](https://megamitensei.fandom.com/wiki/Demonic_Compendium). We have fused together hundreds of small "compilers" in a single LLM, all of which treat a subset of PureScript. Together, they add up to the sum total of the language. By following this approach instead of implementing a single, monolithic compiler, we hope that features such as language extensions and optimization become as easy as adding a new compiler in the mix.
